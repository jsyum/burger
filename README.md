This is an interactive app where a user can add, eat, and delete a burger. 

It uses MySQL to store data, Express to handle routing, and Handlebars to render views. The app uses a custom ORM to query our database.

To use the app, simply enter the burger you'd like to eat in the text form at the bottom of the page to add it to the "Current burgers" section. Click the "Eat me!" button to move the burger into the "Devoured" section. Click "Delete!" to remove a burger.
